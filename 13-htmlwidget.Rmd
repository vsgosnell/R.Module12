Htmlwidgets are R functions that return JavaScript visualizations. The document below uses a leaflet htmlwidget to create an interactive map. 

Htmlwidgets create client side interactions. Since htmlwidgets are exported in JavaScript, any common web browser can execute the interactions.


```{r include = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```

Use the leaflet map below to explore the actual Maunga Whau volcano in Auckland, NZ. 

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng=174.764, lat=-36.877, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=174.764, lat=-36.877, popup="Maunga Whau") 
```
