# Inserting tables into Word

To run this example rmarkdown file, make sure to place it in a folder where you have downloaded the pupae dataset ("pupae.csv")

With a little example data and a few useful functions, we can easily create tables in Word. First, load the example data:
```{r load_pupae_data}
# Load the doBy package
library(doBy)

# read pupae data if you have not already
pupae <- read.csv("pupae.csv")

# Make a table of means and SD of the pupae data
puptab <- summaryBy(Frass + PupalWeight ~ CO2_treatment + T_treatment,
                         FUN=c(mean,sd), data=pupae, na.rm=TRUE)

# It is more convenient to reorder the dataframe to have sd and mean
# together.
puptab <- puptab[,c("CO2_treatment","T_treatment",
                    "Frass.mean","Frass.sd",
                    "PupalWeight.mean","PupalWeight.sd")]


# Give the columns short, easy to type names
names(puptab) <- c("CO2","T","Frass","SD.1","PupalWeight","SD.2")

# Round if the variable is 'double' (i.e. not integer or character)
puptab <- as.data.frame(lapply(puptab,function(x)if(is.double(x))round(x,2)else x))

# Convert temperature, which is a factor, to a character variable
# (Factors don't work well with the data-reshaping that takes place in pixiedust)
puptab$T <- as.character(puptab$T)
```

## Tables with kable
We'll start with kable() from the knitr package. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
kable(puptab, caption="Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data.")
```

### Renaming table columns with kable()
```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(puptab, caption="Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data, with new column names.", 
      col.names=c("CO~2~ Treatment","Temperature","Frass","SD","Pupal Weight", "SD"))
```

### Changing digits and column alignment with kable()
```{r echo=TRUE, }
kable(puptab, caption="Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data.", 
      col.names=c("CO~2~ Treatment","Temperature","Frass","SD","Pupal Weight", "SD"),
      digits=1,
      align=c('l','c','r')) # Values will be recycled to match number of columns
```

##Tables with pander
Another function for formatting tables is pander(), from the pander package. 
```{r  echo=TRUE}
library(pander)
pander(puptab, caption = "Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data, in pander.")
```

### Rounding, cell alignmnet, and emphasis using pander()
```{r  echo=TRUE}
# cell and row emphasis are set before calling pander,
# using functions that start with 'emphasize.':
# emphasize.strong.rows,  emphasize.strong.cols,  emphasize.strong.cells,
# emphasize.italics.rows, emphasize.italics.cols, emphasize.italics.cells
emphasize.strong.cols(1)
emphasize.italics.cells(which(puptab == "elevated", arr.ind = TRUE))
pander(puptab, 
       caption = "Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data, with cell formatting in pander.",
       # for justify, length must match number of columns
       justify = c('left', 'center', 'right','right','right','right'),
       round=3)
```

##Tables with pixiedust
A third option for formatting tables is the pixiedust package. It uses a different syntax from those we've seen so far:
```{r echo=TRUE}
# pixiedust requires broom for table formatting
library(broom)
library(pixiedust)

dust(puptab) %>%
  sprinkle_print_method("markdown")
```

### Adding emphasis and rounding with pixiedust
Note that each change is specified as a separate 'sprinkle':
```{r echo=TRUE}
dust(puptab) %>%
  sprinkle_print_method("markdown")  %>%
  sprinkle(rows = c(2, 4), bold = TRUE) %>%
  sprinkle(rows = c(3, 4), cols=c(1, 1), italic = TRUE) %>%
  sprinkle(round = 1)
```

### Adding captions, changing column names, and replacing values with pixiedust
Note that the caption argument is placed inside the dust function, and not as a separate sprinkle.
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Captions are added to the dust() function
dust(puptab, caption="Table 1. Summary stats for the pupae data, formatted with pixiedust") %>%
  # Note that identical column names are not allowed
  sprinkle_colnames("CO2 Treatment","Temperature","Frass","Frass SD","Pupal Weight", "Weight SD") %>%
  # Replacement must have the same length as what it replaces
  sprinkle(cols = 1, replace = c("ambient", "ambient", "elevated", "elevated")) %>%
  sprinkle_print_method("markdown")
   
```
