Render collections of R Markdown documents into a website with the rmarkdown::render_site function. Each .Rmd file becomes a page of the site.


Each website requires

a file named _site.yml, which provides the global YAML header for the site
a .Rmd file named index.Rmd, which provides the content for the home page of your website.
Execute the rmarkdown::render_site function from within the directory containing your files to build _site, a directory of files ready to deploy as a standalone static website.

Better yet, create an RStudio Project for your directory. RStudio will add a Build tab to the IDE that you can use to build and preview your site.

# **R Markdown**

### *Dynamic Documents for R* {style="padding-top: 0px;"}

R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (an easy to write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. 

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).

R Markdown has many available output formats including [HTML](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html), [PDF](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html), [MS Word](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html), [Beamer](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html), [HTML5 slides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html), [Tufte handouts](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html), [books](https://bookdown.org), [dashboards](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), and [websites](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).
